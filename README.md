📬 Spam Mail Prediction – Project Overview

🧩 Project Summary

This project is a machine learning-based text classification system that predicts whether an email message is spam or not spam using Natural Language Processing (NLP). By analyzing the patterns and frequency of words in emails, the model can intelligently filter out unwanted messages—emulating how spam filters work in real-world email services.

🧠 Programming Language

->Python 3
Chosen for its extensive machine learning libraries and simplicity in handling data.

📁 Dataset

A CSV file containing labeled email data, with two primary columns:

->label – Indicates whether the message is spam or ham (not spam).

->message – The raw text content of the email.

This dataset is used for training and evaluating the prediction model.

🧰 Libraries & Tools Used

->Pandas – For data loading, cleaning, and manipulation.

->NumPy – For numerical operations.

->Matplotlib / Seaborn – For visualizing class distributions and message properties.

->Scikit-learn (sklearn) – Core ML engine used for:

->Text vectorization (CountVectorizer / TfidfVectorizer)

->Train-test split

->Model training (Multinomial Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression)

->Accuracy & classification report

->NLP Techniques – Tokenization, stop-word removal, vectorization

🛠️ Core Functionalities

->Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
Handles noise in raw email text—removes stopwords, lowercases, tokenizes, and vectorizes the content.

->Feature Extraction
Uses Bag-of-Words and TF-IDF models to convert text into numerical features that a machine learning model can understand.

->Model Training
Trains using algorithms like Multinomial Naive Bayes, which is well-suited for text classification tasks.

->Evaluation
Displays accuracy, confusion matrix, and precision-recall scores to evaluate model performance.

->Real-Time Prediction
Accepts custom user input to classify messages on the fly.

💡 Use Case

->This project simulates how email providers like Gmail and Outlook filter spam, making it a perfect beginner-to-intermediate ML project to showcase skills in:

->Text processing

->Feature engineering

->Classification

->End-to-end model building
